This repository is here to allow you to practise [`lab09_deploy`](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=COMP1531/23T3/students/_/lab09_deploy), please see the full instructions there. You WILL need to modify this repository to complete `lab09_deply`.

The `src/` folder contains a stripped down lab05_forum solution that implements persistence, allowing us to demonstrate the need for a deployed database.
