This repository is here to allow you to practise [`lab10_deploy`](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=DPST1093/24T1/students/_/lab10_deploy), please see the full instructions there. You WILL need to modify this repository to complete `lab10_deploy`.

The `src/` folder contains a stripped down lab05_06_forum solution that implements persistence, allowing us to demonstrate the need for a deployed database.
